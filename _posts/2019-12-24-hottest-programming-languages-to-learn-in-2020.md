The begin of 21st century saw a rise in demand of skills in programming. Computer sciences/ engineering was the most preferred subject of graduation among students. But this time around by the end of 2nd decade software engineers are not the only one who own this skill set. Every graduate irrespective of their background is expected to have knowledge in at least one of the most used programming language by the companies recruiting them. The competitive world has made it a point that schools have started curriculum with new subjects such as C and python.
Now there is always a fresh set of people who irrespective of their backgrounds are coming forward to learn programming languages. Choosing the right one for their job and career can be daunting with around 700 programming languages to choose from (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages).
Just to make it easier we have come up with a comprehensive list of the most in demand programming languages in 2020. Our analysis is considering data from leading open source platforms such as GitHub and Stack Overflow.

## Front Runners
Let us have a look at the top programming languages based on their user base.
Yes, JavaScript is continuing its supremacy as top programming language 2019. But 2020 will see a new champion. You guessed it right that will be python. In terms of Community question asked per month Python took over Java in 2019 and it is after JavaScript for Numero Uno spot. Growing popularity in NodeJS also not helping JavaScript either because typescript is taking its share in UI development.

#### Python
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
since it is a general-purpose programming language, you can use the it for developing both desktop and web applications. Also, you can use Python for developing complex scientific and numeric applications. It is designed with features to facilitate data analysis and visualization.
Latest boom in Data science clearly reflects in the growth in popularity of Python programming language as it is the most preferred language for Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Data Visualization and Deep Learning. No Wonder Pandas is the top used tags among the python packages in stack overflow followed by Django, Matplotlib another package for data science and Flask.
Python is used at major tech companies for some of their major products. Some of the notable names include 

+ Google
+ Microsoft
+ Amazon
+ Netflix
+ Facebook

2020 is expected to see some major growth in the fields of Data science. If you are planning to be ready for a tasty challenge in 2020 train yourself in python to solve many daily life problems.

#### JavaScript
JavaScript, The programming language of Internet. 

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, just-in-time compiled, object-oriented programming language
Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. Most websites use it, and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

JavaScript is developed by Brendon Eich at Netscape. Later it became a standard in web development. Now it is maintained by ECMAScript an opensource community driven organization.

Birth of Node.js in 2009 age JavaScript a big boom in server-side development.

Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

It is no exaggeration that JavaScript is still the widely used programming language based on its sheer user base. There are over 1.6 billion web sites in the world, and JavaScript is used on 95% of them, that is a staggering 1.52 billion web sites with JavaScript. JavaScript in its various forms sees its usage in Web Development, Server-Side Scripting, IoT etc.

2020 will not be any different for JavaScript but the increase in typescript (a superscript of JavaScript) will see a little decline its usage in web development. If you are thinking to venture yourself into web development, JavaScript is a must.

#### Java

Java is the Big Brother of programming languages when it comes to it popularity and wide userbase. Since its inception in 1995 (24 years old, hence the Big Brother) it has been one of the most sought-after skill set in software industry. Java is one of the widely taught programming languages in the grad schools, that makes it quite popular in dev circles right from the young age.

Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

Java still dominates various lists like TIOBE, Octaverse etc in popular programming languages. Java is not going to go anywhere. Given its wide range of usage in applications it worth learning (in case you haven’t).

John Cook has an interesting post about his predictions for programming languages. As per that java is going to outlive many new coming languages like Go, C#, python. Given it is already 24 years old is quite a long run. 

## People Champion
These programming languages are garnering a good response from the programming community. Adding these skillsets in a developer’s arsenal will be handy in 2020.

#### RUST

Rust has been the "most loved programming language" in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey every year since 2016. When 83.5% of the world’s biggest developer forum like it, there must be something good going on in here.
Rust is a programming language developed by Mozilla. Rust is a multi-paradigm system programming language focused on safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically like C++ but is designed to provide better memory safety while maintaining high performance.

#### Kotlin

Behold!! the JAVA alternative is here. It is said to conquer major share in mobile application development space.

Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of its standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript or native code (via LLVM). Language development costs are borne by JetBrains, while the Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark.

From Android studio v3.0 Kotlin is included in as an option to select along with standard java compiler.  The Android Kotlin compiler lets the user choose between targeting Java 6 or Java 8 compatible bytecode.

Its ability to create both android (Kotlin/JVM) and iOS (Kotlin/Native) applications makes it a hot skillset to master in 2020.

#### Dart

The fastest growing programming language in GitHub (It is observed to grow by 500+% in YoY usage). Flutter is the one of GitHub’s most popular open source projects and Dart is the language used to write Flutter apps.

Dart is a cross functional programming language originally build for Flutter by Google. It can be used to build mobile, desktop, backend and web applications. Are you are doing cross platform apps in 2020? Dart is worth a shot.

#### Typescript

Typescript is an object oriented strictly typed superset on JavaScript from Microsoft. Yes, it transpiles into JavaScript. That is the reason many may oppose it to be a programming language but, Typescript is seeing a steady growth its userbase thanks to modern web UI frameworks like Angular.

You can agree or deny but the fact is Typescript is eating JavaScript market. UI development in 2020 can see more such contribution to Typescript.

Growth in TypeScript and drop in JavaScript is not a coincidence as both operate more in UI development space. 


#### Go

Go is not only loved by people but also one of the most wanted programming languages in 2019 (Stack overflow Developer survey 2019). It is mostly used for building largescale and complex software.
Go, also known as Golang is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically like C that boasts the user friendliness of dynamically typed, interpreted languages like Python, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.

There are two major implementations:
+ Google's self-hosting compiler toolchain targeting multiple operating systems, mobile devices, and WebAssembly.
+ gccgo, a GCC frontend.
A third party transpiler, GopherJS, compiles Go to JavaScript for front-end web development.
